Here is the code and dataset sharing of the CVPR2024Workshop paper: Two-Person Interaction Augmentation with Skeleton Priors. Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05490

Code will be coming soon.

The dataset introduction is in the Chapter 4 and the Supplementary Material in our paper. 

The dataset (9 seed interaction motions, 351k frames) link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1v4rooeiB2WMZp3gn3-Q6eH2txPpRAI6W

In each seed motion in google drive, there are 4 folders called uniform/non-uniform-A/B, uniform means the bone length variation is adapted in every bone where non-uniform is adapted in only one bone. 
A/B stands for different characters, which is same as the description in the paper.
